The Genesis default Shortcodes were never easier before!\r\n\r\n*Backstory:* Since I figured out the Shortcake plugin (aka \"Shortcode UI\") is a really nice and genius project it was clear I had to do something for Genesis with it. So this is the first result! :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n\r\n* Visual Shortcode interface - totally simple and easy! :)\r\n* Big advantage: You don't have to remember the Shortcode attributes names etc.!\r\n* Mobile! The Shortcake base plugin is very powerful and also works fully on mobile - so just have fun ;-)\r\n* Developer friendly: customize or extend via filters\r\n* Fully internationalized and translateable! -- German translations already packaged!\r\n* Developed with security in mind: proper WordPress coding standards and security functions - escape all the things! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugin Installation:\r\n\r\n**Requirements/ Prerequisites**\r\n* [WordPress v4.1.0 or higher](https://wordpress.org/download/)\r\n* [Genesis Framework v2.3.1 or higher](http://deckerweb.de/go/genesis/)\r\n* [\"Shortcake\" plugin (Shortcode UI) v0.6.2 or higher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/screenshots/)\r\n* *PLEASE: For security and best support, always use the latest stable versions of WordPress, Genesis and plugins!*\r\n\r\n**Manual Upload**\r\n* Download current .zip archive from master branch here, URL: [https://github.com/deckerweb/genesis-shortcode-ui/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/deckerweb/genesis-shortcode-ui/archive/master.zip)\r\n* Unzip the package, then **rename the folder to `genesis-shortcode-ui`**, then upload renamed folder via SFTP/ FTP to your WordPress plugin directory\r\n* Activate the plugin\r\n\r\n**Via \"GitHub Updater\" Plugin** *(recommended!)*\r\n\r\n* Install & activate the \"GitHub Updater\" plugin, get from here: [https://github.com/afragen/github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)\r\n* Recommended: set your API Token in the plugin's settings\r\n* Go to \"Settings > GitHub Updater > Install Plugin\"\r\n* Paste the GitHub URL `https://github.com/deckerweb/genesis-shortcode-ui` in the \"Plugin URI\" field (branch \"master\" is pre-set), then hit the \"Install Plugin\" button there\r\n* Install & activate the plugin\r\n\r\n**Updates**\r\n* Are done via the plugin \"GitHub Updater\" (see above) - leveraging the default WordPress update system!\r\n* Setting your GitHub API Token is recommended! :)\r\n* It's so easy and seamless you won't find any better solution for this ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage - 1) Basics:\r\n\r\n* In the edit screen for Posts, Pages, Custom Post types click the button \"Add Media\" (above the editor window) and then on the left click \"Add Post Element\"\r\n* This will give you a nice overview list of all available Shortcodes: just choose any of the Genesis ones and change the attributes if necessary\r\n* Then embed it to your post content and you're done!\r\n* Once you want to edit an existing Shortcode, inserted before, just hover over its line in the content editor and you'll get presented with an edit icon (pencil icon): just click it and change the attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage - 2) Advanced:\r\n\r\n* Shortcode UI is automatically available where the Visual Editor of WordPress is available including the \"Add Media\" button\r\n* That means you can use the Shortcodes UI in Page Builders, Widgets with the Visual Editor etc.\r\n* Example Page Builder plugin: [\"SiteOrigin Page Builder\" (via WordPress.org)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/screenshots/)\r\n* Example Widget plugin: [\"Visual Text Editor\" (via WordPress.org)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/visual-text-editor/screenshots/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage - 3) Limitations, Info etc.:\r\n\r\n* *Limitation:* For some attributes that get entered via the Shortcode UI, the whitespace gets trimmed. This is the current behavior (or issue?) of the *Shortcake* plugin\r\n * However, this only affects the Shortcode preview within the editor\r\n * The Shortcode attributes are inserted properly, including spaces/ whitespace!\r\n * And, most importantly, the rendering on the frontend of your site will also include space/ whitespace you've entered in the UI!\r\n * *Note: I might discuss this with the Shortcake team if this could be improved*\r\n* *Limitation:* Currently, the Shortcake plugin displays no preview Icon or Image for Shortcodes rendered as one line in the Editor.\r\n * It's only a visual thing: the rendered view is still clickable and editable for the whole line in the Editor! (In the same way as for built-in WordPress Shortcodes like \"gallery\".)\r\n * *Note: I might discuss this as well with the Shortcake team if this could be improved*\r\n* *Limitation:* The \"Back to Top\" Shortcode from Genesis was left out, intentionally, as it makes no sense to use this old XHTML/ HTML 4 feature any longer!\r\n* *Bonus:* Otherwise, the originally \"hidden\" `url` attribute in Shortcode \"Footer Genesis Link\" was included as it makes total sense especially for affiliate links! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugin Filters (Developers) - 1) Basics:\r\n\r\n* `gsui_filter_genesis_label` --> modify the label \"Genesis\" to anything you want (presented in the Shortcode overview list)\r\n* `gsui_filter_genesis_logo_image` --> modify the image path for the Genesis logo - absolute path is needed!\r\n* `gsui_filter_genesis_logo` --> modify the complete output of image path or Dashicon class for the logo/ icon\r\n* `gsui_filter_shortcode_ui_args_{shortcode_tag}` --> filter arguments for one Shortcode tag for Shortcode UI (Shortcake plugin)\r\n* `gsui_filter_genesis_shortcodes_ui_args` --> filter arguments for any/all Shortcodes for Shortcode UI (Shortcake plugin)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugin Filters - 2) Examples\r\n\r\n**Exclude one or more Shortcode tags from the UI**\r\n\r\nTo exclude one of the Genesis default Shortcodes from appearing in the UI, just use this code snippet from **[this Gist https://gist.github.com/deckerweb/65bf8c1c38f95cffcb9e2e2dda344345](https://gist.github.com/deckerweb/65bf8c1c38f95cffcb9e2e2dda344345)**\r\n\r\nJust uncommend all those lines with the Shortcode tags you don't want to see in the UI.\r\n\r\nIn the filter `gsui_filter_genesis_shortcodes_ui_args` place the Genesis Shortcode tag together with the prefix `sp_`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$genesis_shortcodes[ 'sp_footer_studiopress_link' ] = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Change the overview logo for a certain Shortcode in the UI**\r\n\r\nTo change the logo icon/ image in the UI overview, let's say, to a Dashicon from WordPress itself -- just use the code snippet from **[this Gist https://gist.github.com/deckerweb/eeaaa76d469ff0205878f7d2bd6bf21f](https://gist.github.com/deckerweb/eeaaa76d469ff0205878f7d2bd6bf21f)**\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies for all other Dashicon icons and Shortcode tags as well.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my built-in icon types, choose one of the following:\r\n```\r\n$genesis_shortcodes[ 'sp_footer_site_title' ][ 'listItemImage' ] = ddw_gsui_genesis_logo( 'post' );\r\n```\r\n--> will output my \"post\"-based icon\r\n\r\n```\r\n$genesis_shortcodes[ 'sp_post_date' ][ 'listItemImage' ] = ddw_gsui_genesis_logo( 'footer' );\r\n```\r\n--> will output my \"footer\"-based icon\r\n\r\n```\r\n$genesis_shortcodes[ 'sp_post_time' ][ 'listItemImage' ] = ddw_gsui_genesis_logo( 'default' );\r\n```\r\n--> will output my \"default\"-based icon (Genesis)\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to change to your own custom image path, simply change this line to this:\r\n```\r\n$genesis_shortcodes[ 'sp_post_tags' ][ 'listItemImage' ] = ddw_gsui_genesis_logo( 'custom', '', 'http://example.com/path-to-your-image-file.png' );\r\n```\r\n--> will output your own image file\r\n\r\nTips: Use transparent .png with a size of 120x120px - bigger size might be fine, it gets scaled by Shortcake CSS anyway... :)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where to put these filters/ code snippets?**\r\n* In a custom plugin/ functionality plugin!\r\n* OR in a snippets manager like [\"Code Snippets\" plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)\r\n* OR in your Genesis Child Theme's `functions.php` file or in a other theme specific \"functions\" file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translations:\r\n= Localization & Internationalizaton:\r\n\r\n* Used textdomain: `genesis-shortcode-ui`\r\n* Default `.pot` file included\r\n* German translations included (`de_DE`)\r\n* Plugin's own path for translations: `wp-content/plugins/genesis-shortcode-ui/languages/genesis-shortcode-ui-de_DE.mo`\r\n* *Recommended:* Global WordPress lang dir path for translations: `wp-content/languages/plugins/genesis-shortcode-ui-de_DE.mo` ---> *NOTE: if this file/path exists it will be loaded at higher priority than the plugin path! This is the recommended path & way to store your translations as it is update-safe and allows for custom translations!*\r\n* Recommended translation tools: *Poedit Pro v1.8+* or *WordPress Plugin \"Loco Translate\"* or *your IDE/ Code Editor* or *old WordPress plugin \"Codestyling Localization\"* (for the brave who know what they are doing :) )\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog - Version History:\r\n\r\n--> See plugin file [CHANGES.md here](https://github.com/deckerweb/genesis-shortcode-ui/blob/master/CHANGES.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Todo:\r\n\r\n* [x] Enhance Readme documentation and code snippets\r\n* [x] Improve taxonomy selector for 'post_terms' Shortcode\r\n* [ ] Add screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 David Decker - DECKERWEB.de\r\n",
