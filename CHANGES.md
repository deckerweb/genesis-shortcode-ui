#### Version 2016-08-22

* Return early if Genesis and Shortcake plugin are not active - both or one of the two.
* The attributes `relative_depth` from the Shortcodes "Post Date" and "Post Modified Date" were now implemented as well, as they make totally sense, also in the UI! ([More info on this](http://www.billerickson.net/genesis-relative-date-length/))
* Changed the logo image/ icon logic to have different logos/ icons for Footer Shortcodes and Post Shortcodes by default
 * This way, the whole thing is more flexible and filterable for you!
 * Even WordPress Dashicon icons are supported!
 * And, you guess it, also your custom image paths are now supported as well! :)
 * *Please Note: the default packaged icons are still served as .png image files, no .svg yet, sadly -- because on mobile browser support for .svg in <img> tag is still not good... :(*
* Updated packaged German translations
* Readme update with corrections, editions and updates :)


#### Version 2016-08-19

* Initial release on GitHub
